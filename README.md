# conditions-and-loops
 conditional statements and loops are two fundamental concepts that enable us to control the flow of a program.

Conditional statements are used to execute a block of code if a certain condition is met. The most common conditional statements are if, else if, and else.

Loops, on the other hand, are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. The most common loops are for, while, and do-while loops.

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of each:

If statement: Executes a block of code if a certain condition is true.
Else-if statement: Executes a block of code if the previous condition was false and the current condition is true.
Else statement: Executes a block of code if all previous conditions were false.
For loop: Executes a block of code for a specified number of times.
While loop: Executes a block of code repeatedly as long as the specified condition is true.
Do-while loop: Executes a block of code at least once, then repeatedly as long as the specified condition is true.
